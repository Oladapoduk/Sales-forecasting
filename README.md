# Item Sale Prediction

This project is about predicting the sales of items in different stores based on various attributes. The dataset used in this project includes item attributes such as weight, fat content, type, and MRP, as well as store attributes such as size, location type, and establishment year. The target variable is the item outlet sales.

# Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sales of items in different stores. To achieve this goal, we will do the following:

1.Preprocess the data and engineer new features

2.Train machine learning models using different algorithms and hyperparameters

3.Combine the predictions of these models using an ensemble method

4.Evaluate the performance of the ensemble model on a testing set

# Project Steps
Here are the steps we will follow to complete this project:

1.Data preprocessing and feature engineering

2.Exploratory data analysis to gain insights and validate assumptions

3.Machine learning modeling using different algorithms and hyperparameters

4.Ensemble modeling to combine the predictions of multiple models

5.Model evaluation on a testing set using appropriate metrics

# Healthiness Score
In addition to the item and store attributes, we will also create a "healthiness" score for each item based on its weight and fat content. This score will be used as an input to our machine learning models and could potentially improve the accuracy of our predictions.

# Ensemble Modeling
To improve the accuracy of our predictions, we will use an ensemble method to combine the predictions of multiple machine learning models. This will help reduce the bias or variance of individual models and improve the overall performance of our model.

# Technologies Used
Here are the technologies and tools we will be using for this project:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

GitHub

# Conclusion
In this project, we will be predicting the sales of items in different stores using various item and store attributes. We will use machine learning modeling and ensemble methods to improve the accuracy of our predictions. We hope that this project will provide insights and value to businesses looking to make informed decisions about inventory management and marketing strategies.
