IDEAS

Healthiness score: To create a healthiness score for each item, you could use a combination of the item weight and fat content, as you mentioned. One way to do this is to create a new feature that calculates the ratio of fat content to weight. You could then use this feature as an input to your machine learning model, which could potentially improve the accuracy of your predictions.

Ensemble modelling: To create an ensemble of machine learning models, you could train multiple models using different algorithms or different hyperparameters. For example, you could train a linear regression model, a decision tree model, and a random forest model, and then combine their predictions to get the final prediction. This could help reduce the bias or variance of individual models and improve the accuracy of your predictions.
